You are tasked with performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews. You will analyze each review and classify its sentiment into one of the following categories: Excellent, Good, Average, Poor, or Bad. The analysis should be based on the overall tone and content of the review. Provide a confidence score from 0 to 1, indicating how certain you are about the classification. Additionally, explain the reasoning behind your classification based on the content of the review.

The output must be formatted in JSON with the following structure:

{
  "sentiment": "Excellent/Good/Average/Poor/Bad",

  "reason": "Explanation for why this sentiment was assigned"
}
