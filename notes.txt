- Need to upload image to Docker hub (change `build` to `image`)
- See how to run a docker container on digital ocean
- Do you need to persist any data if the container shuts down unexpectedly? (don't think so)
- How to restart application if it dies during production
- Does Docker need any additional security in production?

Things to do:

1) Club all the code into a utils.py file
2) Need to add a secret token for verification
3) Add error codes for the following:
    - data format is incorrect
    - user is not authorized (secret code is incorrect)
    - output from openai model is incorrect

But do we need to wait to see if they are going to stabilize? (Cnv down 28% since we raised the threshold).\nI would like to Increase the WDT tamper price to $89. With the dosing funnel add on the price would be $112 which after the Joe10 discount would mean the customer still gets the free shipping threshold and feels like they are getting a deal.\nLet me know your thoughts. But there has definitely been a huge drop in WDT tampers sold. Down 40% since we upped the threshold."
